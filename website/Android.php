    The following are steps everyone can follow to install and 
    start using Whatsapp services on android devices.
    <div class="steps">
    <ol class="list">
        <Li>Go to the Google Play Store, then search for WhatsApp Messenger.
             Tap INSTALL</Li>
        <Li>Open WhatsApp and continue to the next screen by agreeing to WhatsApp 
            Terms of Service.</Li>
        <Li>Register using your phone number.</Li>
        <Li>If a backup of your chat history was found and you would like to
             restore it, choose Restore and continue.</Li>
        <Li>Enter your name. You can also change this later in WhatsApp by tapping 
            More options.
            After finishing these steps, you will be able to send and 
            receive messages.

    <h2>Follow these steps to uninstall WhatsApp successfully</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you feel like uninstalling your WhatsApp, I recommend
             using the Chat Backup feature to back up your messages
              before you delete WhatsApp from your device because you might
              need those messages for one reason or another.</li>
        <li>Go to your device's Settings.</li>
        <li>Tap Apps & notifications > WhatsApp > Uninstall 
            to remove the app and all of its data.</li>
            <li>Note that WhatsApp can also be uninstalled by clicking 
            the button that says <b>Uninstall</b> from Playstore after searching for it on Playstore.</li>
