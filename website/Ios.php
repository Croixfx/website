       <h2>How to Download and register on WhatsApp On IOS Devices</h2> 
       <p>
        The following are steps everyone can follow to install and 
        start using Whatsapp services on Ios devices.
        <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <Li>Find WhatsApp Messenger in the Apple App Store, then tap GET.</Li>
            <Li>Open WhatsApp and continue to the next screen by agreeing to WhatsApp 
                Terms of Service.</Li>
            <Li>Register using your phone number.</Li>
            <Li>If a backup of your chat history was found and you would like to
                 restore it, choose Restore and continue.</Li>
            <Li>Enter your name. You can also change this later in WhatsApp by tapping 
                More options.
                After finishing these steps, you will be able to send and 
                receive messages.
            </Li>
            
        </ol>
        </div>

       <div>
        <h2>Follow these steps to uninstall WhatsApp successfully</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you feel like uninstalling your WhatsApp, I recommend
                 using the Chat Backup feature to back up your messages
                  before you delete WhatsApp from your device because you might
                  need those messages for one reason or another. Note that this
                is optional.</li>
            <li>Touch and hold the WhatsApp icon on the Home Screen until the icons start to wiggle.</li>
            <li>Tap the x in the corner of the WhatsApp icon.</li>
            <li>Tap Delete to remove the app and all of its data.</li>
